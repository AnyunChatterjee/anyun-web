this is the codebase for my personal website. the goal was to make a low-weight website while capturing my personal aesthetic and conveying my academic and professional portfolio. 

i use this website to test out basic principles of ux design as well, since i want to make sure visitors are able to intuitively navigate the site to learn what they want to about me. 

codebase weight as of 8/7/24: 

39 kilobytes of html 

6 kilobytes of css (basically just the bootstrap library)

2.5 megabytes of javascript (literally just using js for button logic and animating accordions. so it might not be worth)

one 78 kilobyte jpg file (i know it should be webp, i'll make that update at some point)

17 megabytes of statically linked pdfs (my cv, teaching statement, collateral from research projects, and syllabi for courses i've taught)



total weight: ~26 megabytes


total weight of initally loaded content: ~8.5 megabytes
