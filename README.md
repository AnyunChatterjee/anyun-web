this is the codebase for my personal website. the goal was to make a low-weight website while capturing my personal aesthetic and conveying my academic and professional portfolio. 

i use this website to test out basic principles of ux design as well, since i want to make sure visitors are able to intuitively navigate the site to learn what they want to about me.
